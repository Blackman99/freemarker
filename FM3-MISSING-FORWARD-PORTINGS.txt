Things not yet forward-ported from 2.3-gae
------------------------------------------

- Lambda-like expressions: The way those work in 2.x is limited because of BC restrictions. So it should work differently here.

- ?with_args/?with_args_last: Have to implement the better null handling in the template language first

- Some of the Gradle build refinements, like signature related and, rebroducible build stuff

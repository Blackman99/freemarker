Things not yet forward-ported from 2.3-gae
------------------------------------------

- Lambda-like expressions: The way those work in 2.x is limited because of BC restrictions. So it should work differently here.

- MethodCallAwareTemplateHashModel, and anything related to it. This is what allows both myRecord.x and myRecord.x() give
  the same result. But in FM3 we certainly should go for separate method and non-method namespace, which makes the 2.x
  implementation unapplicable.

- ?with_args/?with_args_last: Have to implement the better null handling in the template language first

- Some of the Gradle build refinements, like signature related and, reproducible build stuff

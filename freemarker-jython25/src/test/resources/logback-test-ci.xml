	  In Continuous Integration mode the Ant junit task is configured to print the failed test details to the console,
	  because we can't get the JUnit report on Travis CI, but see what was printed to the console. But then, for some
	  reason, the stdout of the tests will be echoed on the console as well. Thus we have to prevent it being flooded
	  by logs messages.
